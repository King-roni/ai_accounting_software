# Pre-Testing Readiness Audit — 2026-06-01

**Verdict: NOT yet walkable end-to-end by a tester.** The build is broad and the
units are healthy (web tsc+eslint clean, api 312/314 tests pass), but a cluster
of integration/ops blockers means the core journey (upload → classify → match →
ledger → finalize → adjust → export) cannot currently be completed in the app.
This is a *readiness* gap, not a code-quality gap — most fixes are small.

Method: read-only multi-agent audit (34 agents, ~2.3M tokens, 839 tool calls)
across 9 subsystems + adversarial verification of every Blocker/High + a
completeness critic. Source: workflow `pretest-readiness-audit` (run
`wf_c5c2d33b-771`). Tested against the **live** project `noxvmnxrqlzsdfngfiww`
(the live DB is the source of truth — see rebuild note below).

---

## Two corrections to prior assumptions (verified)

1. **The orchestrator phase handlers are NOT stubs.** `phases.py:214-217` overrides
   the literal registry with real engines — `CLASSIFICATION`, `MATCHING`,
   `INCOME_MATCHING`, `LEDGER_PREPARATION` all run real per-transaction work.
   `handle_wiring_pending` ends up bound to **zero** phases. Only `AI_END_SCAN` +
   `EVIDENCE_DISCOVERY_EMAIL/DRIVE` are genuine stubs. The pipeline CAN run
   deterministically end-to-end (no AI keys needed) **once a run is actually driven**.
   (The `phases.py` module docstring is stale and says otherwise — misleading.)
2. **The REQUIRE_STEP_UP bug does NOT block the finalize/approve path.**
   `transition_run`, `out/in_workflow_user_approval` all handle `REQUIRE_STEP_UP`
   correctly. The bug bites `request_statement_upload` (active, but that RPC is
   **orphaned** — the live upload path uses `request_raw_upload` + the *patched*
   `complete_statement_upload`) plus **7 latent** admin RPCs whose surfaces aren't
   step-up today. Real blast radius is smaller than "9 RPCs deny OWNER" implied.

---

## BLOCKERS — must fix (or stand up a harness) before meaningful testing

1. **`execute_lock_sequence` has zero callers → monthly runs can never reach
   FINALIZED via the app.** `FinalizationChecklist.approveWithStepUp` only records
   an approval; nothing calls the lock sequence (the engine treats `FINALIZATION`
   as an await-approval sentinel). Fix: have the checklist call
   `execute_lock_sequence(run, actor, {})` after a successful step-up approval
   (mirror `AdjustmentFinalizePanel.refinalize`), or add a worker step. Cascades:
   no archive package → R7.8 Archive/adjustment UI unreachable.
2. **Worker can't drive the seeded runs.** `WORKER_SYSTEM_ACTOR_USER_ID` is unset
   and the 4 seeded runs have `started_by=null` + empty `principal_snapshot`, so
   `require_actor()` raises → `safe_drive_run` swallows it as CRASH → runs sit at
   CREATED forever. Worse: the seeded runs are non-canonical (the real
   start/upload paths populate the actor), so even setting the env var won't drive
   *those* rows. Fix: set the env var to the demo owner AND re-seed runs via
   `out_workflow_start_run_manually`/`create_paired_workflow_runs`, or backfill
   `started_by`+snapshot.
3. **No worker is running and nothing schedules the tick.** pg_cron only has the
   daily invoice/pro-forma jobs; the tick endpoint is 503 (no `WORKER_TICK_SECRET`).
   Nothing advances runs/exports/ingestion automatically. Fix: run
   `python -m cyprus_bookkeeping_api.worker` for the test window (poll 5s).
4. **Default accounting period = current month (June 2026), which has zero demo
   data.** Dashboard/Transactions/Ledger open empty; the dashboard "month-to-date"
   headline shows 0 while rolling-12m has data (mixed signal). All demo data is
   Feb–May 2026. Fix: default the period to the latest month with data, or seed a
   current-month row, or add an "empty period — jump to May" hint.
5. **Statement-upload journey dead-ends silently.** Upload enqueues an outbox row;
   `consume_statement_upload_completed_event` only runs inside the worker tick (not
   running). UI polls "Queued" forever, no error. Fix: run the worker + add a
   stuck-detection timeout in `RecentUploads`.
6. **No MFA factor seeded for admin@admin.com.** Every step-up-gated flow
   (finalize, team role-change/remove, integration disconnect) dead-ends at "MFA
   not enrolled". Fix: seed a verified TOTP factor + recovery codes, or make
   "enroll authenticator" the explicit first step of the test script.
7. **No global `error.tsx`/`not-found.tsx`/`global-error.tsx`.** Any
   server-component throw or bad URL drops the tester onto a raw Next.js crash/404
   with no recovery. Several async server pages (`integrations`, `team`) have
   unguarded awaits. Fix: add branded error + not-found boundaries with a
   "Back to dashboard" action.
8. **Finalization preconditions can't be satisfied for demo data + no finalized
   period exists.** Unclassified txns → HIGH `classification.needs_confirmation`
   issues that `gate_finalization_zero_blocking_issues` treats as blocking, with
   **no in-app RPC to confirm/resolve a classification issue**. Fix: add a
   classify-confirm RPC+UI, and/or seed a fully-processed + FINALIZED period (under
   the `seed-r79` teardown tag) so R7.8 Archive/adjustment is demoable.

## SHOULD-FIX (HIGH) — fix before broad testing or scope explicitly

- **REQUIRE_STEP_UP stale-vocab sweep (8 RPCs).** `request_statement_upload`
  (active, orphaned) + `activate_redaction_policy`, `deploy_prompt`,
  `rollback_prompt`, `register_prompt`, `grant_cost_ceiling_override`,
  `update_business_ai_config`, `update_business_cost_ceiling` (latent). Change
  `NOT IN ('ALLOW','STEP_UP')` → `NOT IN ('ALLOW','STEP_UP','REQUIRE_STEP_UP')` and
  add a guard test. (The P0.2 patch only fixed `complete_statement_upload` +
  `trigger_run_manual` and noted ~9 remain.)
- **No realtime/polling on run/period/matching/ledger screens** → the app looks
  frozen during async backend work (phases never tick forward without a manual
  reload). Add a `refreshInterval` while a run is non-terminal, or a Supabase
  realtime subscription.
- **`adjustment_records` dead-code** — `check_adjustment_intake_gate`,
  `record_adjustment_finalization_handoff`, unattached
  `fn_check_adjustment_record_run_type` reference non-existent columns
  (`workflow_run_id`, `target_record_type`) → 42703 if reached. Fix to `run_id` or
  retire. (Not on the live re-finalize path, so latent.)
- **Demo fixtures too shallow / inconsistent.** `match_records` (3) contradict
  `transactions.match_status` (all UNMATCHED); pre-existing progressed-state rows
  (matches/reviews/notifications/exports) aren't produced by the seed nor cleared
  by reset; Feb/Mar transactions have no `workflow_run`; no raw CSV bytes in
  storage (can't re-parse). Reconcile under the `seed-r79` tag.
- **Migration rebuild integrity.** Two divergent rebuild artifacts (233 repo
  migrations vs the `_baseline/` MCP-introspected snapshot, which post-dates
  a6*/p0_*/r7_*), neither replay-verified; no `supabase/config.toml`; ledger drift
  (264 live vs 233 repo); `p0_2..p0_5` not in the live ledger. **Test against the
  live DB only**; reconcile before any fresh rebuild / branch DB.
- **Keys-gated integrations are inert (overlaps P2/R8).** Anthropic key not in the
  `secrets.managed_secrets` vault → Tier-3 AI raises; OCR is Google Document AI and
  the Python runner is unwritten (PDFs silently skipped despite the UI promising
  OCR); Google OAuth unset → integrations "Connect" throws. Scope AI/OCR/integration
  testing OUT of this pass, or provision keys (P2).

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS / scope-out for first test pass

- Ledger surface is empty until a run is driven (depends on Blockers 2/3).
- Multi-business aggregation unexercised (demo owner has one business).
- Invoice "Preview PDF data" returns a JSON payload, not a rendered PDF.
- Integrations page is off-brand + chrome-less; Help is a "coming soon" placeholder;
  per-session revoke + MFA recovery-code regen are deferred (copy is dev-facing).
- Mobile: period switcher is hidden < sm, so a mobile tester can't escape the empty
  default period.

## MEDIUM/LOW hygiene (post-test or opportunistic)

- 39 tracked `__pycache__/*.pyc` (27 dirty) despite `.gitignore` → `git rm -r
  --cached` them. No CI pipeline. Zero web unit tests (e2e is the only web coverage,
  brittle to seed literals). 17 SECURITY DEFINER views (verify each tenant-filters).
  `vies_checks` RLS-on/no-policy (deny-all; confirm reads go via SECDEF). No
  run-claim lease (single-worker only). Live prod-grade secrets in plaintext on disk
  (rotate before distribution). FastAPI CORS hardcoded to localhost; no security
  response headers; `export-artifacts` bucket omitted from the at-rest self-check;
  placeholder SPKI pins block APP_ENV=production startup (R4/P3).

---

## What IS testable right now (steer testers here)

Set the period to **May 2026** first, then: Transactions (view), Documents,
Invoices (list/detail/create — not PDF render), Clients (+ VIES badges),
Subscriptions, Reports (catalogue + download the 2 COMPLETED exports), Matching
(switch filter to "All matches"), Reviews (snooze/assign — 4 issues), Notifications
(bell + drawer + mark-read — 4 unread), Team (invite/list), Account (profile, MFA
*enroll*, sign-out-others). VIES is the one live external integration that works.

## Recommended pre-test fix order

1. Set `WORKER_SYSTEM_ACTOR_USER_ID` + run the worker (Blockers 2,3).
2. Re-seed runs canonically + a fully-processed + FINALIZED May period (Blockers 2,8; fixtures).
3. Wire `execute_lock_sequence` into FinalizationChecklist (Blocker 1).
4. Default period → latest-with-data; add error/not-found boundaries (Blockers 4,7).
5. Add refresh interval to run/period screens; stuck-detect on uploads (Blocker 5, HIGH).
6. REQUIRE_STEP_UP 8-RPC sweep + adjustment_records dead-code fix (HIGH).
7. Seed an MFA factor or script "enroll first" (Blocker 6).

# UPDATE — Phase-A fixes landed + re-audit verdict (2026-06-02)

**New verdict: WALKABLE for guided testing (GO with caveats).** The core journey
machinery is proven end-to-end on live data: a May OUT run was driven
upload→classify→**confirm**→match→ledger→**FINALIZED** (archive `019e848a`, v1
manifest) → **adjustment → v2 manifest**; April OUT reaches AWAITING_APPROVAL
(multi-period unblocked). web tsc+eslint clean; api pytest 312 passed / 3 skipped
(the 3 live-DB tests skip without creds). A read-only adversarial re-audit (7
subsystems + adversarial verification + critic) confirmed **all Phase-A fixes
hold** with live-DB + file:line evidence.

## Phase-A fixes landed (committed, main ff'd, pushed)

Migrations `20260601000010..000017` (live + repo) + web changes:
- **B7 (real bug, not "missing"):** `record_classification_user_confirmed` wrote
  `resolution_action='CONFIRM'` (not in the enum → 22P02; confirm path was
  *unreachable*). Added `CONFIRM_CLASSIFICATION` enum value + fixed the RPC.
- **H1:** REQUIRE_STEP_UP swept across the 8 RPCs (dynamic in-place rewrite) +
  `list_stale_step_up_guard_functions()` sentinel + `test_step_up_vocab_guard.py`.
- **H3:** `adjustment_records` dead-code → `run_id`/`delta_kind`.
- **B1/B3/B6/H2/B4 (web):** finalize→`execute_lock_sequence` wiring; latest-period
  default; branded `error/not-found/global-error`; gated live SWR refresh;
  RecentUploads stuck-detection.
- **B2:** `WORKER_SYSTEM_ACTOR_USER_ID` set; runs re-seeded canonically via
  `out_workflow_start_run_manually`; worker drives them.
- **NEW blocker found+fixed:** `evaluate_classify_entry_gate` was business-wide →
  **every run after the first classification held forever** (broke all
  multi-period + post-finalization runs). Now advances (engine only touches
  PENDING; shared-phase dedup guards the sibling).
- **NEW bug found+fixed:** `apply_income_match` emitted unregistered
  `income_matching.{full_match,partial_payment,overpayment}` → 23503 crash on any
  income match. Registered the 3 types.
- **B5:** MFA seeding via SQL is unreliable on hosted GoTrue (encrypted factor
  secret); enrollment is **step 1 of the test script** (sanctioned alternative).
- **H4:** match_records↔match_status reconciled (stale CONFIRMED records removed);
  driven state documented as intentional; 39 tracked `*.pyc` untracked.
- **H5:** repo↔live ledger drift (live 271 vs repo 240) reconfirmed; **test
  against live only** this phase (unchanged guidance).

## Re-audit NEW findings (beyond the original audit)

| # | Sev | Finding | Status |
|---|-----|---------|--------|
| N1 | BLOCKER | **Finalize step-up bypassed MFA** — checklist minted the token via client-side `issue_step_up_token` (role-only, no MFA challenge). | **FIXED** — routed through MFA-gated `StepUpModal`/`verifyStepUp` |
| N2 | BLOCKER | `prepare_ledger_entries` re-run hits FK 23503 (`review_issues_draft_ledger_entry_id_fkey`, NO-ACTION) — blind delete+reinsert of draft entries referenced by review_issues. Forward-drive OK; **re-drive of a held IN run fails.** | OPEN (logged) — candidate fix: upsert / SET NULL with issue re-link |
| N3 | HIGH | `permission_matrix` drift: DB has 23 surfaces/138 rows vs the 15-member Python `PermissionSurface` enum (incl. a stray lowercase `workflow_run`); breaks RLS parity test under live creds. | OPEN (logged) |
| N4 | MED | `evaluate_classify_exit_gate` also business-wide (latent cross-period hold; same class as the entry-gate fix). | OPEN (logged) |
| N5 | MED | `create_paired_workflow_runs` leaves `principal_snapshot` empty (masked for MANUAL by `started_by` backfill; EVENT runs depend on the settings fallback). | OPEN (logged) |
| N6 | MED | `issue_step_up_token` surface is unvalidated free text (no matrix check). | OPEN (logged) |
| N7 | MED | Sentinel `list_stale_step_up_guard_functions()` was anon/authenticated EXECUTE-able (REVOKE FROM PUBLIC no-op). | **FIXED** — REVOKE from the roles |
| N8 | LOW | `ActorResolutionError` degrades to an opaque repeating `CRASH` log (deployment hygiene). | OPEN (logged) |
| N9 | LOW | `(app)/error.tsx` not vertically centred. | **FIXED** |
| — | n/a | `match_records`↔`match_status` (2 records vs UNMATCHED) — **NOT a bug**: proposed matches (`MATCHED_NEEDS_CONFIRMATION`/`POSSIBLE_MATCH`, `requires_user_confirmation=true`) correctly leave the txn UNMATCHED until confirmed (good Phase-C content). | by-design |

## Demo state stood up (live, business `0e…b1`)

May OUT FINALIZED + OUT_ADJUSTMENT FINALIZED (archive `019e848a`, v1+v2); April
OUT AWAITING_APPROVAL (a finalize-via-UI target); May+April IN at REVIEW_HOLD
(income review); 2 proposed match_records; 3 OPEN review issues; 24 draft ledger
entries; 0 phantom finalization issues.

**Go/no-go:** **GO for guided OUT-journey testing** (upload→classify→match→review
→ledger→finalize→adjust→archive→export all walkable). **Caveat:** IN *finalize*
is blocked by N2 (re-drive FK) — exercise IN via the review queue (confirm
proposed matches/classifications) but route the finalize test through OUT. MFA
must be enrolled first (B5). N3 (matrix drift) is a security-hygiene follow-up,
not a tester blocker.

# PHASE C — guided E2E (real browser) + final go/no-go (2026-06-02)

Driven as the demo OWNER (admin@admin.com) against the live DB via the local
Next.js dev server + the orchestrator worker. Screenshots in `.playwright-mcp/`
(`phaseC-01..04`).

## What was walked successfully (end-to-end, in the real UI)

1. **Login** → dashboard (period correctly defaults to **May 2026**, the latest
   month with data — B3 holds; dashboard cards all live).
2. **MFA enrollment** (Account → Multi-factor → Enroll authenticator): QR + TOTP
   verified, **8 recovery codes** generated (B5 path validated; secret captured
   to drive step-up).
3. **Upload** a Revolut CSV (June 2026) → worker **parsed it** → 6 transactions
   created → **classified** → **June OUT run auto-driven to AWAITING_APPROVAL**,
   June IN to REVIEW_HOLD. The upload→parse→classify→drive pipeline + the
   multi-period classify-gate fix work live.
4. **Review queue** populated with real issues (needs-confirmation + missing-docs).
5. **Finalize via UI** (June OUT): data-preconditions ready → "Approve & finalize"
   → **MFA step-up modal** (N1 fix: real challenge, not a silent token mint) →
   TOTP verified → **run FINALIZED + archive package + v1 manifest created**.
6. **Periods/Archive**: May Finalized + its Adjustment (v2), June Finalized,
   April awaiting — all render; Archive tab present.
7. **Nav sweep**: Dashboard, Transactions, Invoices, Documents, Matching, Ledger,
   Reviews, Periods, Reports, Subscriptions, Team, Clients all render with no
   crash. Branded **error boundary** caught the `/help` 500 ("Something went
   wrong" + recovery) and the **not-found** boundary rendered for a bad URL
   (B6 validated on a real crash).

## Fixed during Phase C (committed)

Driving the real UI exposed several blockers the prior audits missed (they only
tested single runs / SQL paths):
- **Worker `tick()` 22P02** — `sorted(DRIVABLE_STATUSES)` sent `RunStatus` enum
  members (`"RunStatus.CREATED"`) to the status filter; every tick failed. Fixed
  (`.value`). The worker had literally never ticked.
- **Finalize-via-UI deadlock** — "Approve & finalize" gated on the *full* master
  gate (which requires a step-up approval that only that button creates). Fixed:
  gate on data-preconditions; the click records the step-up approval + locks.
- **Finalize token surface mismatch** — modal minted the token for `FINALIZATION`
  but the approval RPC consumes `APPROVAL_STEP_UP` → `STEP_UP_TOKEN_INVALID`.
  Fixed: mint for `APPROVAL_STEP_UP`.
- (+ N1 MFA-bypass + N7 sentinel grant + N9 error.tsx centering, above.)

## Open defects logged this pass (Plane cycle, BOOK-952…963)

BLOCKER: **C1** review queue can't resolve issues (only Snooze/Assign → can't
clear a fresh upload's issues in-app); **N2** `prepare_ledger_entries` re-run FK.
HIGH: **N3** permission_matrix drift. MEDIUM: **C5** `/help` 500, **N4** classify
exit gate business-wide, **N5** empty principal_snapshot, **N6** step-up token
surface unvalidated. LOW: **C6** 405 on a gate RPC fetch, **C7** checklist stale
after approve, **C8** off-brand login, **C9** uploads list stale until reload,
**N8** opaque ActorResolutionError.

## FINAL VERDICT: **GO (with caveats) — open the product to guided testers.**

The full bookkeeping journey is walkable end-to-end in the real UI for the OUT
side (upload→classify→match→review→ledger→**finalize (MFA)**→archive→adjust), and
the demo carries a finalized+adjusted period for Archive. Required tester
guidance / known limitations:
- **Enroll MFA first** (Account → Multi-factor) — step 1 of the script.
- **Confirm classifications via SQL/admin until C1 lands** — the review queue UI
  can't yet resolve a needs-confirmation/missing-doc issue, so a *fresh upload*
  can't be finalized purely in-app without C1. The pre-driven May/June finalized
  periods + the OUT finalize flow are fully demoable.
- **Don't re-drive a held IN run** until N2 is fixed (re-run FK).
- AI/OCR/integrations remain scoped out (P2 keys); Help 500s (caught by the
  boundary); matrix-drift (N3) is a security-hygiene follow-up.
- The worker (`python -m cyprus_bookkeeping_api.worker`, `WORKER_SYSTEM_ACTOR_USER_ID`
  set) and the dev server must be running for the test window.
